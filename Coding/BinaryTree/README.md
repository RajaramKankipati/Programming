# BST

The invariant representation in BST is that the the left nodes are less than the element and right nodes are greater than the element. 

## Important points to remember 

Recursion is used to solve the binary search tree problems 

## Traversals: 

1. DFS: Uses stack
    * InOrder   : Left Root Right
    * PreOrder  : Root Left Right
    * PostOrder : Left Right Root

2. BFS: Uses queue 
    * LevelOrder  : Level by level 
    * ZigZagOrder : Level by level alternating order
